**Exercise 1**
My clean code principles:
1. Choosing good names
My secure coding practices:
None
My mistake in my source code:
1. Source code don't sanitize user inputs at all.
2. Create product form don't create product when I press Submit in Spring Boot
How to improve my code:
1. Sanitize all user inputs to improve app security from SQL Injection and XSS Scripting
2. I don't know how to fix the second mistake in my source code
**Exercise 2**
1. After writing the unit test, how do you feel? How many unit tests should be made in a class? How to make sure that our unit tests are enough to verify our program? It would be good if you learned about code coverage. Code coverage is a metric that can help you understand how much of your source is tested. If you have 100% code coverage, does that mean your code has no bugs or errors?
After I write the unit test, I feel easier to ensure if the program is running properly. But to feel easier to verify our program, I must achieve the comprehensive code coverage, implementing diverse test case scenarios, and incorporating robust testing practices. But the 100% code coverage, doesn't mean my code has no bugs or no errors and code coverage doesn't determine the logic is correct. The code coverage only guarantees that every line of code was executed during tests.
